🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

🚀 Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application that simulates the core functionalities of Airbnb. It enables users to register, list properties, make bookings, process payments, and leave reviews. This project focuses on backend development using modern technologies and best practices in software engineering.
🎯 Project Goals
- Implement secure user authentication and management.
- Create and manage property listings.
- Develop a functional booking system.
- Integrate a reliable payment processing system.
- Enable user reviews and ratings.
- Ensure performance and scalability through database optimization and caching.
👥 Team Roles
•	Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, defines business logic, and integrates various components of the system.
•	Database Administrator: Designs the database schema, manages data integrity, and ensures optimal query performance.
•	DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the backend services. Sets up Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
•	QA Engineer: Writes and manages test cases to ensure backend functionalities are robust and bug-free. Conducts integration and regression testing.
⚙️ Technology Stack
•	Django: A Python web framework used to build and manage RESTful APIs efficiently.
•	Django REST Framework: Provides powerful tools for building REST APIs with Django.
•	PostgreSQL: A relational database system used to store structured data for users, properties, bookings, etc.
•	GraphQL: Allows flexible and efficient data queries from the client.
•	Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
•	Redis: Used for caching frequently accessed data and managing background task queues.
•	Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments using containers.
•	GitHub Actions: Used for automating testing, building, and deploying the application.
🗃️ Database Design
Key Entities & Fields:
•	User: id, username, email, password_hash, role (host or guest)
•	Property: id, title, description, price_per_night, host_id (FK to User)
•	Booking: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), check_in_date, check_out_date
•	Review: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment
•	Payment: id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_status, payment_date
Entity Relationships:
- A User can own multiple Properties.
- A User can make multiple Bookings.
- A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.
- A Property can have multiple Reviews.
- Each Booking has one associated Payment.
🧩 Feature Breakdown
•	User Management: Enables users to register, login, update profiles, and manage sessions.
•	Property Management: Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
•	Booking System: Allows users to reserve properties, specify dates, and view booking history.
•	Payment Processing: Integrates a secure system to handle booking payments.
•	Review System: Guests can leave reviews and rate properties after a stay.
🔐 API Security
Key Measures:
- Authentication: Secure login using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
- Authorization: Ensures users can only access or modify resources they own.
- Rate Limiting: Prevents API abuse.
- Input Validation: Protects against common vulnerabilities.
- HTTPS Enforcement: Secures data transmission.

Why Security Matters:
- Protecting user data.
- Securing payment information.
- Ensuring data integrity.
🔁 CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates building, testing, and deploying code changes. It helps ensure fast, reliable, and consistent software delivery.

Tools Used:
- GitHub Actions: For automation.
- Docker: For consistent environments.
- Docker Compose: For multi-service orchestration.
